# **Helm**

Helm is an all-in one productivity management application built for the Windows OS. This application is built with students as the target audience. Days are sorted by periods, rather than hours, allowing students to more accurately and efficiently plan out their days.

## **Installation**
To install this application on a Windows 10+ device, run the "**[Helm Installer.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Shy9G1_d1TbM5MN7QmJSzZiCX_JoM_hG/view?usp=sharing)**"

#### If you have downloaded this project as a .zip folder, then everything should be set up already. Just run "Helm.exe" once you have extracted the files.

- **IMPORTANT**: As I was unable to authenticate my digital signature, you will need to disable your antivirus in order to run the installer.
- This application was built on the .NET 7.0 framework, which you may need to install the runtime. The downloads can be found [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

### Key Features

There are a variety of unique and customizable features to enable students to maximize their efficiency:

  1. **Reminders** - The application includes a reminder system which allows the user to create reminders. The user will enter what they want to be reminded about, along with the time and date, and the program will send a windows notification at the given time.
  2. **Notes** - The app additionally includes a note-taking system. Users can write down notes with a title and its content, and it will save to be kept for the future.
  3. **Links** - There is also a system for having quick links. There are a few default ones provided to useful websites, but users can also create their own custom links if they want something to be saved for quick access in the future.

### Limitations

At the current stage in time, the application does not fully save all information entered.
The application needs to remain open for the reminder system to work.
